# Object-Damage-Detection-Internship-Project

Worked on Adanced Image Processing and its various libraries like rembg, matplotlib, segment_anything (For SAM Model), cv2, opencv to bulid a system which recognizes the damage that may have happened to an object pre and post rent, from its images of pre rental and post rental timmes.
Used the pretrained SAM model for calculation of Damage Mask. 
Gained experience in Siamese Model, Torch and Supervision library too.
The model was correctly able to find damage and generate appropriate damage mask for any pre aligned pre and post rental images.
